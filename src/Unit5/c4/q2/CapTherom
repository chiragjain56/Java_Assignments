Q2. What is CAP theorem, discuss a scenario where CAP theorem helps you choose a
technology over the other or helps you make a design decision.

Ans: CAP--> Consistency , Availability, Partition Tolerance;

According to cap theoram ,
a distributed database system can only guarantee two out of these characteristics: Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance.

lets take one scenario:
In a multi-master architecture(allows data to be stored by a group of computers ), data can be written in
multiple nodes.
suppose there are two nodes in data base ,when a message is write to Node A syncs the update with Node B,
and read requests sent to either of the two nodes will return the updated result.

                         -------------------------
                         |       Database        |
        *client -------->| NodeA<--------->NodeB |
                         |                       |
                         -------------------------

If there is a network partition between Node A and Node B, then updates cannot be synced.
Node B wouldn’t know that Node A received an update, and Node A wouldn’t know if Node B received an update.
The behavior of either node after receiving a write request depends on whether the database prioritizes consistency or availability.

                         ---------------------------
                         |       Database          |
        *client ---?---> |  NodeA<-----X---->NodeB |
                         |                         |
                         ---------------------------
