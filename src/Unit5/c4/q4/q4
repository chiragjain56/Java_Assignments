Q4
a) What do you know about client server architecture?

Client server architecture is a computing model has two basic components, a client and a server.

Client: The one that requests services. e.g. web browser, mobile app etc
Server: The one that supplies the requested services by the client. Application
Server, DB server, Rest Endpoint.

example:
Mail servers, file servers, web servers etc

b) What is caching, explain its use cases.

Caches are used to store temporary files, using hardware and software components.

uses:
1.to increase data retrieval performance by reducing the need to access the underlying slower storage layer.
2.Trading off capacity for speed
3. its store a subset of data transiently.

c) what are web sockets where it is used.

WebSockets allow both the server and the client to push messages at any time without
any relation to a previous request.
it is used in:
Collaborative editing/coding. Multiplayer games. Location-based apps.

d) How are public and private keys used in encryption and decryption?

Public and private keys form the basis for public key cryptography(asymmetric cryptography).
In public key cryptography, every public key matches to only one private key. Together, they are used to encrypt and decrypt messages.
If you encode a message using a personâ€™s public key, they can only decode it using their matching private key.

below explaination make more clear:

Private Key
The private key is used to both encrypt and decrypt the data.
This key is shared between the sender and receiver of the encrypted sensitive information.
The private key is also called symmetric being common for both parties. Private key cryptography is faster than public-key cryptography mechanism.

Public Key
The public key is used to encrypt and a private key is used decrypt the data.
The private key is shared between the sender and receiver of the encrypted sensitive information.
The public key is also called asymmetric cryptography.
